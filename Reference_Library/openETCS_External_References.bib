	abstract = {{UML} 2.0, which is the standard modeling language for object-oriented systems, has only an informally given semantics. This is in particular the case for {UML} 2.0 state machines, which are widely used for modeling the reactive behavior of objects. In this paper, a list of 29 newly detected trouble spots consisting of ambiguities, inconsistencies, and unnecessarily strong restrictions of {UML} 2.0 state machines is given and illustrated using 6 state machines having a problematic meaning; suggestions for improvement are presented. In particular, we show that the concepts of history, priority, and entry/exit points have to be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {Git is the version control system developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development. It took the open source world by storm since its inception in 2005, and is used by small development shops and giants like Google, Red Hat, and {IBM}, and of course many open source projects. A book by Git experts to turn you into a Git expert Introduces the world of distributed version control Shows how to build a Git development workflow What youll learn Use Git as a programmer or a project leader. Become a fluent Git user. Use distributed features of Git to the full. Acquire the ability to insert Git in the development workflow. Migrate programming projects from other {SCMs} to Git. Learn how to extend Git. Who is this book for? This book is for all open source developers: you are bound to encounter it somewhere in the course of your working life. Proprietary software developers will appreciate Gits enormous scalability, since it is used for the Linux project, which comprises thousands of developers and testers.

	volume = {33},
	abstract = {Using the {openETCS} initiative as a starting point, we describe how open software can be applied in combination with platform-specific, potentially closed- source extensions, in the development, verification, validation and certification of safety-critical railway control systems. We analyse the safety and security threats presented by this approach and discuss conventional operating system partitioning mechanisms, as well as virtualisation methods with respect to their potential to over- come these problems. Furthermore, we advocate a shift from open source to open models, in order to increase the development efficiency of combined open and pro- prietary solutions},
